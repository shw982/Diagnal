- The app consists of one screen which shows a list of contents. It displays content's image and its title, shown in a vertically scrolling grid

- The list is retrieved from the json files available in the project inside Resources folder.

- The design pattern that I have used is MVVM design pattern.

- The class ContentListViewController is responsible for displaying content to the user.

- The view-model class ContentListViewModel is responsible for co-ordinating between the model and the view.

- I have created some constants files for Icons and Fonts.

- Added the required test cases for view model class.

- I have made the necessary UI adjustments to make the design compatible for all iOS mobile devices
